# RikaRelief

<!-- ## Hi there üëã -->

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Introduction

Greetings, since you are looking at this we guess you are interested in what the organization is all about. We are aiming to solve the relief
problem using a mix of technologies and disciplines. As the name suggests this will be a peer driven effort both in developing the technologies involved
and also carrying out the relief goals.

Design, Mathematics, Programming and Problems. Now what do those have to do with what we want to accomplish here? We'll employ concepts from mathematics,
programming and computers, among other disciplines to help solve problems plaguing our community. We shall start with the relief problem and see what
happens. This multi-disciplinary approach will help us see the problems we choose to tackle through diverse light.
