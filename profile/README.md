<!-- ## Hi there üëã -->

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Introduction

Greetings, since you are looking at this we guess you are interested in what our little organization is all about. Three words; Mathematics, Programming
and Problems. Now what do those have to do with what we want to accomplish here? We'll employ concepts from mathematics, programming and
computers, among other disciplines to solve problems plaguing our community. We shall start with the relief problem and see what happens. This
multi-disciplinary approach will help us see the problems we choose to tackle through diverse light.

We are currently very early stage and as such we could use all the help we can get.

## Contribution guidelines

For now open an issue in [this](https://github.com/RikaRelief/.github) repository and we will respond with appropriate steps to take. This page will be
updated in future for further guides on how to contribute as the organization grows in scope and size.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources

You can take a peek at the wikis of public repositories belonging to the organization for more information on the particular repositories.

Join our Swae [workspace](https://rikarelief.swae.io/sign-up) for discussions of ideas and our goals.

Here is a [wiki](https://github.com/RikaRelief/.github/wiki) highlighting some information about the organization and the platform. And some other fun
entries.

## üçø Fun facts

- We eat proofs for breakfast
- We formalize anything we can, makes life easier.

## Organization main components

- **Research**: This arm is mainly concerned with the research goals of the organization, particularly in line with the current problem(s) we would be tackling, this will involve writing papers to showcase what the relevant parties have been upto.
- **Development**: This will deal with the products we'll be building to help solve the problem(s) we are working on. This will mainly comprise of software for now. Builders will reside here.
- **Design**: This will be the dreaming section. Here we'll have all things software design, UI design, UX design, graphic design and anything that can be labelled a design field.
- **Public Relations**: For interaction with the world, this will involve marketing, legal and other public facing matters.
- **Finance**: All things money.

Over time we plan to 'incorporate' all these divisions as internal software platforms which will be inline with our values. This will also be beneficial
in terms of accountability, management and oversight.

Contributions are welcome in all these areas and we are open to suggestions for more.
