# RikaRelief

<!-- ## Hi there üëã -->

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Introduction

Greetings, since you are looking at this we guess you are interested in what our little organization is all about. We are aiming to solve the relief
problem using a mix of technologies and disciplines. As the name suggests this will be a peer driven effort both in developing the technologies involved
and also carrying out the relief goals.

Design, Mathematics, Programming and Problems. Now what do those have to do with what we want to accomplish here? We'll employ concepts from mathematics,
programming and computers, among other disciplines to help solve problems plaguing our community. We shall start with the relief problem and see what
happens. This multi-disciplinary approach will help us see the problems we choose to tackle through diverse light.

## Contribution guidelines

If this seems like something you are into, even remotely, please do reach out.

We are currently very early stage and as such we could use all the help we can get.

interesting entries.

## üçø Fun facts

- We formalize anything we can, makes life easier.
- We play with shapes all day.
- We engage in a form of wizardry called mathemagic üßô.

## Organization main components

- **Research**: This arm is mainly concerned with the research goals of the organization, particularly in line with the current problem(s) we would be
  tackling, this will involve writing papers and blog posts to showcase what the relevant parties have been up to. We'll mostly be using the language of
  of category theory to guide our research endeavors.

- **Development**: This will deal with the products we'll be building to help solve the problem(s) we are working on. This will mainly comprise of software for now.

- **Design**: This will be the dreaming section. Here we'll have all things software design, UI design, UX design, graphic design and anything that can be labelled a design activity.

- **Public Relations**: For interaction with the *real* world, this will involve marketing, legal and other public facing matters.

- **Finance**: All things money.

Over time we plan to 'incorporate' all these divisions as internal software platforms which will be inline with our values. This will also be beneficial
in terms of accountability, management and oversight.

Contributions are welcome in all these areas and we are open to suggestions for more.
