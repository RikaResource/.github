## Hi there üëã

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Introduction

RikaRelief is an organization aimed at solving resource related problems. For instance; famine relief.

We'll employ concepts from design, mathematics, computer science and economics, among other disciplines to help solve problems plaguing various
communities. This multi-disciplinary approach will help us see the problems we choose to tackle through diverse light.

As the name suggests this will be a peer driven effort both in building the technologies involved and also in the functioning of the system.

## The Vision

We want to create a network of community controlled resources that are used to solve problems contributed to the network. We will start with disaster
relief problems and later we hope to allow any other resource related problem. Additionally, as this is partly a scientific exploration in the use of novel
economic systems we want to do as many 'crazy' things in the design and implementation of resource organization (management) as we can.

## How you can help

If this seems like something you are into, feel free to reach out.

We are currently at a very early stage and as such we could use all the help we can get.

For now open an issue in [this](https://github.com/RikaRelief/.github) repository and we will respond with appropriate steps to take. This page will be
updated in future for further guides on how to contribute as the organization grows in scope and size.
